			<p>I am currently a senior at the Athenian School in Danville, CA

  			</a> 
   				I am currently working at the Blackhawk Country club where I instruct and teach children the fundamentals of tennis. Tennis is a big part of my life and daily routine. Whether it is playing a match for my highschool tennis team or just hitting with a friend I will always be down to hit around. Another one of my hobbies is playing video games with my friends and I am currently hooked on the new Madden.
